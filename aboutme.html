                    Technology and I have not always seen eye to eye. I never considered myself a technologically advanced person— quite the opposite actually. If you’d asked me three years ago where I’d be now I’d tell you about my technology free dreams of being somewhere in a  remote rainforest studying chimpanzees, 
                    or a dreary forest in Washington pondering the mycelium of mushroom, or living some other relatively technology-free, hippie life. Back then, I would have laughed at the unimaginable idea that I would ever even dream of working behind a screen.</p><br>

                    <p style="text-align: center;">Then, Covid-19 happened.  </p><br>
                    
                    <p style="text-align: center;">When everyone was sentenced to house arrest by an indiscriminately violent strand of mere RNA, everyone had to turn to the internet to stay connected. I had no choice but to face my enemy— the computer. The girl who printed out all of the lecture slides so she wouldn’t have to buy a new laptop suddenly had no choice but to make nice with technology. </p> <br>
                    
                    <p style="text-align: center;">So, cautiously I began to get to know computers and all that they had to offer. Shockingly, I didn’t die— a good first step. Once I had found a decent level of comfort (and a lot of peer pressure from friends) I started playing and streaming video games on my laptop. I actually made somewhat of a minor job out of it through social media. </p> <br>
                    
                    <p style="text-align: center;"> A sudden burst of hubris must have overcome me— I had defeated the computer as my enemy after all— and I just knew that I could do more. I decided that I wanted to make my own games. I began with studying HTML first, then CSS, and eventually JavaScript. </p> <br>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">I am currently learning even more than I thought I could with 1150 academy.
